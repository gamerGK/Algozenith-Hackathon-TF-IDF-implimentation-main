## Features

- Web scraping: The search engine scrapes question data from websites such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and CodeChef using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.
- TF-IDF algorithm: It implements the TF-IDF algorithm to find potential documents (questions) related to the user's query.
- Web application: The search engine is integrated into a web application built with Flask and HTML, allowing users to search for questions and view the results.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/oxone-999/Coding-Problem-Search-Engine.git

2. Install dependencies:

- Make sure you have beautiful soup and selenium installed in your workspace

  ```shell
  pip install bsoup
  ```
  ```shell
  pip install selenium

- if getting error after installing the libraries

  ```shell
  pip install -user bsoup selenium
  ```
for intalling it globally

- For hosting the backend locally go to Website/Backend

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

  ```shell
  node server.js
  ```
- For hosting the frontend locally go to Website/Frontend/my_app/

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
  ```shell
  npm start
  ```
- Now you are good to go, now the website will be hosted on http://localhost:3000

## Usage

1. Perform a search:

- Enter a query in the search box.
-  Select the website you want to search
- The search engine will process the query using the TF-IDF algorithm and display relevant questions as results.
